# Jenkins Job Manipulation scripts ⚡️

## Project Briefing

Jenkins is an open source automation server. It helps automate the parts of software development related to building, testing, and deploying, facilitating continuous integration and continuous delivery.

I recently learned about it and currently experimenting with Jenkins scripts for automating tasks through a pipeline having multiple stages. This repo would have several Jenkinsfile which would spawn jobs in your Jenkins server.

Aside from this, it would also have Python and bash scripts which would be used inside the Jenkins jobs and various stages.
I am also using a python package called 'Python-jenkins' which allows control of various tasks running on your Jenkins server through Python using Jenkins API. For instance, you can create, delete, see info related to various jobs running in Jenkins using Python script.
